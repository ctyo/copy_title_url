## Note

This chrome extension is an enhanced version of [Copy Title+URL to clipboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/copy-title%20url-to-clipboa/hbnaclhngkhpmpgmfakaghgjbblokeeh) 

I used to like it a lot, but it is not in active development, (still in chrome version 1 format), and not support copy as markdown. So I decided to upgrade this extension to 2.0 version with Markdown Support.
